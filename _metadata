  "description" : "[h1]Welcome to a brand new way to play Starbound![/h1]\n\nThis mod adds the ability to raise stats to make your character stronger. Simply go out there and fight monsters, and once some xp drops, you'll learn how to craft the Mysterious Book, which enables you to do a whole bunch of cool things.\n\nWith each level you gain through collecting XP, you'll be able to allocate stat points and unlock new techs. In order to start adding stats, pick from 6 classes: Knight, Wizard, Ninja, Soldier, Rogue, and Explorer. Each one has their own style of play and special abilities and techs.\n\nIf you would like to see more information about classes, stats, experience, leveling, techs, compatibility, effects, or crafting, please visit this google docs page: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1t6rcD43adAM1sUD4cOROOJJXa24PZYnYy0-5a12O3Us/edit?usp=sharing\n\n[b]In order to start allocating stats, you must craft the Mysterious Book using 1 XP from your personal crafting menu, OR download QuickBar Mini: http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1088459034 [/b]\n\n[h1]What you can do![/h1]\n[list]\n[*]Collect XP from monsters and raise your level. After collecting some XP, press [C] to open your player's crafting menu so that you may craft the Mysterious Book.\n[*]Check your level and needed XP in the Overview Tab (O).\n[*]Check your stats and raise them if possible in the Stats Tab (S).\n[*]Choose and then check your current class, as well as unlock techs when possible, in the Class Tab (C).\n[*][b]Start a questline that culminates in an awesome weapon that can be upgraded twice (Class Tab).[/b]\n[*][b]Toggle Hardcore Mode, causing all classes to have negatives in addition to their positives (Overview Tab).[/b]\n[*][b]Choose and then check your current Affinity in the Affinity Tab (A).[/b]\n[*]Check the actual effects of your raised stats by going to the Info Tab (I).\n[/list]\n\n[b]In order to use Techs that require the [G] button to activate, you must configure that button in your controls configuration.[/b]\n\n[h1]What I Will Add Soon[/h1]\n[list]\n[*]We are currently on break (probably until Starbound 1.4 drops), but will still be monitoring chat and the Google Doc!\n[*]Add Affinity Upgrade Pages that drop from Guardians. - Coming Next.\n[*]Create Subclasses and Specializations that change up your Class. - Coming Second.\n[*]Balance the stats, classes, and techs depending on feedback. - Constant.\n[*]An interactive quest line with cool rewards. - Coming Last.\n[*]Incredibly dangerous Raid Bosses. - Coming Last.\n[/list]\n\n[h1]Warning[/h1]\nThis mod adds effects to your characters, and as such, you will not see your characters if you remove this mod after using it without going through a couple of steps (listed below). Because of this, I recommend you backup your current storage, or start a new character. As I update this mod, stat distribution may change slightly, so your character may become under or overpowered.\n\nIf you would like to keep your character after unsubscribing, simply follow these steps:\n[list]\n[*]First, go into admin and type 'enableTech ivrpgremove'.\n[*]Then select it as your tech and remove the Mysterious Book from your inventory.\n[*]Make sure you are not being affected by any effects, like Rogue's Toxic Aura.\n[*]Lastly, press F. If you had any class effects, you should see them disappear.\n[*]Quit immediately.\n[*]Unsubscribe and restart your game. If you don't see your character, you may need to load the game with the mod again and simply wait a few minutes before trying the above steps again.\n[*]If you see your character, load it. If the game crashes, load again. You should be able to load your character now.\n[/list]\n\n[h1]Compatibility[/h1]\n[list]\n[*]Yes, this mod should work with Frackin Universe and Frackin Races.\n[*]If there are any problems, just tell me. I will fix them as soon as possible.\n[/list]\n\nHere are some things you can do to test the stats, or to forcibly raise your level:\n[list]\n[*]You can spawn in the different stats. They are simply called 'stat'point, where 'stat' is replaced with the stat name.\n[*]For example, if I wanted to increase Dexterity, I could type \"spawnitem dexteritypoint (amount)\".\n[*]In addition, you can spawn XP by typing \"spawnitem experienceorb (amount)\".\n[*]If you would like to spawn in the Mysterious Book, type \"spawnitem RPGskillbook\"\n[/list]\n\n[h1][b]If you cannot open your book, use '/spawnitem skillbookopen' and voila.[/b][/h1]\n\nPlease enjoy, and tell me if you have any suggestions or concerns about leveling! Please also report any bugs or errors that occur, so that I may fix them!",
