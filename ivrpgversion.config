    Lore Tab:
        More Specialization Lore added to the Lore Tab.
Class Balance:
    Ninja:
        Wall Cling clings to walls with a change to air friction now, rather than approaching the wall with a lot of X Velocity.
        Wall Cling should work even with Changeling's Melty Blood, making it a better option over the regular Wall Jump Tech (which cannot be changed to work well with Melty Blood).
Specializations:
    Changeling: New Ninja+Wizard Dual Specialization.
    Changeling took a long time and was a huge endeavor, and it's incredibly difficult to test every scenario, so there are bound to be balance issues and bugs. Please let me know in the Bugs Discussion Board on Steam, or on the Chucklefish Forums (if that's where you downloaded this).
    Captain:
        By The People Positive Scaling slightly decreased and given a maximum.
