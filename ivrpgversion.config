    Skills:
        Skills can now be equipped. Head to the Skill Tab (K) to do so.
        There are many Skills missing, and some that are currently Disabled. These will not be equippable.
        Gain 1 Skill Point every level up. You should properly gain any missing Skill Points.
        Skills may be changed for balance reasons in the future, as the current selection of Skills is like a beta of the Skill System.
    Specializations:
        Gendered Specializations can now be equipped by the wrong Gender. To do so, head to the Skill Tab and equip the 'True Understanding' Skills in the Body, Mind, and Soul Sections.
Items:
    Reset Scrolls:
        Using any Reset Scroll will refund all Skill Points and unequip your current Skills.
    Caine's Chest:
        Thanks to my Patron, Caine, for requesting and helping design this awesome weapon.
        Caine's Chest is craftable via the Chest tab in the Industrial Workbench.
