"Bug Fixes:
    Oathkeeper's alt ability fixed for Starbound 1.4.
    Passive Bounty Criminals can now be captured.
    Quick Fix: Smith Station should work now.
UI:
    Lore Tab:
        Some New Lore Added.
        Lore can be unlocked via certain actions. These will all be retroactive to be less of a pain for everyone.
        Most lore pages are currently not unlockable.
    Spiral Energy and Spiral Power now use better sprites created by Samey the Hedgehog on Steam.
    Certain Weapons and Items now give credit towards their designers.
Mechanics:
    Added World and Entity Table Overrides for Stealth checks using code from the Active Stealth Module (deprecated) by Wellbott.
    Added friendlyQuery to World Table and Util Script.
    Added closestValidTarget to Entity Table and Util Script.
    AI entities no longer track entities that are invisible or using camouflage.
        Currently applies to Ninja's Shadow Step, Vanish Sphere, Flash Jump, and Wall Cling, as well as Phase Shift's bolt.
        Friendly AI entities (Crew, Pets) will teleport in/out during stealth because they are unable to find you.
    Class Item and Weapon Blueprints now given through the quest itself, rather than only unlocked via the items/weapons, so that players may still get the Blueprints if their inventory is full when receiving the Quest Reward.
Class Balance:
    Explorer:
        Enhanced Dash now defaults to dashing rather than sprinting
    Ninja:
        Wall Cling clings to walls with more force to prevent falling.
        Shadow Step disables gravity while vanished to prevent falling.
        Flash Step and Wall Cling use their own Camouflage and Invulnerable status effect to prevent conflicts with other camouflage/invulnerable-giving effects (Phase Shift, for example).
    Wizard:
        Magic Shield no longer provides double Health recovery from Fall, Fire, and Poison Damage.    
Specializations:
    Captain: New Explorer Specialization.
    Necromancer:
        Bone Pteropods spawned using Reap now follow the player (including teleportation if far away).
    Pioneer:
        Terra Nova (Pioneer's Ability) now includes Teleport Bookmarks thanks to a new Lua function in Starbound 1.4.
